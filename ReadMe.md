# ðŸŽ° Here is my Level Ground webpage mockup!

https://lg-responsive-fjh.netlify.app/

### What I did to build this app:

I used HTML and CSS to code this project. I most used floating as a means of structuring my page.

### Lessons Learned :
- relative units help much more than absolute units when determining the size of elements as the page changes size itself
- Ingrained the notion of inline elements not taking margin or padding measurements regarding height.
